 <h1 class="title">Incredible Pancakes - a delicious, healthy and filling option for breakfast or brunch 
</h1>
 <p>

              </p>
              <p class="additives-contentp">Want to start your day with a delectable yet healthy breakfast that will keep you energised and filled up for long time? There are not many foods that can be a better choice than pancakes.</p>
<br>
              <p class="additives-contentp">Pancake is among the most ethnic form of foods which has deep rooted presence in different cultures across the world. Available in numerous names, tastes, and types in different countries there are two things common in their preparations - a griddle or pan and a batter mix of ingredients... well a spatula too. 

</p><br>

        <p class="additives-contentp">Why do pancakes have so much widespread presence with its history dating back to 5000 years ( researchers debate on having found proof of pancake like food even in the prehistoric time)? The answer to this question probably lies in the simplicity of its preparation - they’re quick cooking that doesn’t require anything more than a pan and a heat source ( prehistoric men probably cooked it on heated rock ). The ingredients can be anything - wheat or rice flours, grains, poultry, vegetables, meats, sea foods, milk -  any combinations are mixed in a semi liquid batter only to be baked or fried on the pan.</p>        
<br>
 <p class="additives-contentp">But the modern day pancakes which are commonly known to most of us have two main races - American pancakes and French pancakes( also known as crepe).  American pancakes are thick and fluffy, made with white flour while the french pancakes are thin and made of wheat or buckwheat flour.</p>    

 <p class="additives-contentp">Often eaten for breakfast or brunch. they tastes are deliciously sweet because they can be topped with cheese, butter, fruit, jam, whipped cream etc. and smothered in chocolate, honey or maple syrup. </p>

           <p class="additives-contentp"><strong>Are you a vegan? Go for gluten free vegan pancakes.</strong></p>
<br>
           <p class="additives-contentp">Traditionally, eggs and buttermilk have often been the main ingredients of pancakes, with even the griddle is greased with butter. But a large number of people being non-veg or purely vegan the ubiquitous pancakes couldn’t deprive them for long. </p>
<br>

           <p class="additives-contentp">There are many recipes of the eggless and vegan pancakes that are comparable to their non-veg counterparts in terms of taste and nutritions. The buckwheat flour and rice flour used in the vegan pancakes add to their nutrition values by making them gluten free. Flaxseed meal is used as an alternative of egg. </p>
<br>
            <p class="additives-contentp">Milk adds flavor to pancakes.If normal milk is not acceptable to pure vegan people then the extra flavor is added to the pancakes by using orange juice, nuts, blueberries, vanilla, raisins,etc. There are also different sources of vegan milk such as from almonds, coconuts, soybeans,etc. which are comparable and good substitute for the animal milk.</p>
<br>
            <p><strong>Eggless Pancake premix</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p class="additives-contentp">Pancake Premixes are ideal for readymade and hasslefree pancakes. Nitin’s eggless pancake premix is one example of high quality mix which can be used for making yummy eggless pancakes in short period of time.
All it requires is making a batter of low to medium density using some amount of Nitin’s eggless pancake premix and proportionate wheat flour mixed with some water. Optionally, you may pour some olive oil into the batter. </p>
<br>
<p class="additives-contentp">A flat non-stick frying pan or tawa, a wooden spatula and a large spoon are the only utensils needed . The frying pan is heated moderately over a gas oven or that sort , varying between low to medium intensities. 
As it starts heating up put  some butter on the pan to get melt and spread all over the pan. You can help spread the butter by swerving the pan in opposite directions.
Then take some batter in the spoon and pour it as evenly as possible on the heated pan and let it get fried for a few minutes till the time you can move the spatula easily underneath to flip it  and see if the golden brown color appears on the fried surface. Then fry the opposite side which will take a little lesser time , this time, and you are done with.</p>
<br>

<p class="additives-contentp">Furthermore, you can use varieties of stuffings and toppings. Nutella, nuts, berries and other fruits like banana, and mango,etc. can be used for staffings. Maple syrup, honey, and chocolate are the favorite toppings for eggless or vegan pancakes.</p>
